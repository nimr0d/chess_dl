# chess_dl
Fast Chess.com bulk game downloader. Parses the games in order to sort into colors and time controls.

I make this project to learn Rust and get an edge in chess tournaments where there is not much time to prepare between rounds. Don't expect good code, but
it is fairly fast.

## Installation
```
cargo install chess_dl
```

## Example

```
chess_dl hikaru gmwso lyonbeast --blitz --bullet -t
```
